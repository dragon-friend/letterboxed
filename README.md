# letterboxed
A simple letterboxed solver written in python

This was mostly an excuse for me to learn filter/map/reduce, as well as python's list comprehensions; what a horrid little language.

Anyway this is 27 lines, doesn't take user input, solves the puzzle in 2 words and doesn't present those words in a pretty way.

You can manually input your letters and the word list you want to use.
