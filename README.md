# letterboxed
a simple solver for the NYT game letterboxed in python

This was mostly an excuse for me to learn filter/map/reduce, as well as python's list comprehensions; what a horrid little language.

Anyway this is 22 lines, doesn't take user input, solves the puzzle in 2 words and doesn't present those words in a pretty way.

You can manually input your letters and the word list you want to use.

feel free to send me any solvers that are shorter than this or work faster
